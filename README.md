# Hi there! 👋
I'm Karandeep Bhardwaj, a passionate software engineer with a keen interest in building robust and scalable cloud architectures. I am highly motivated to learn and implement new technologies and enjoy working on challenging projects.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
Currently, I am focusing on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and exploring its potential to deploy and manage cloud infrastructures using automation tools like Terraform, Ansible, and AWS CloudFormation. I believe IaC can improve the agility, reliability, and scalability of modern cloud architectures.

## 👀 Areas of Interest
My areas of interest include cloud computing, distributed systems, containerization, and microservices architectures. I am fascinated by the possibilities that these technologies offer, and I strive to keep up-to-date with the latest trends and developments.

## 💞️ Looking to Collaborate
I am always open to collaborating with like-minded individuals and teams on exciting projects. I am particularly interested in building clean and maintainable React applications that provide a seamless user experience. If you are working on a project that aligns with my interests, let's collaborate and make it happen!
